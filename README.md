This project contains development helper scripts for distributions derived from
Pragmatux (and Pragmatux itself).

Most scripts are contained in the root directory and can be run from this
directory when not installed (e.g., during development of the scripts). For
scripts written as Python modules within `src/`, keep a symlink in the root
directory for the same reason.
